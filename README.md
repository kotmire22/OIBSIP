Task 1.
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.

I am Build a Supervised Machine Learning Classification Algorithm then predict the flower type using there features.
